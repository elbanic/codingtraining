## Self Checkout

Let's make a simple self-checkout system.
At first, input number of items. After inputting the price and quantity of each item, calculate the subtotal and calculate the 7% tax on the subtotal.
Then output the quantity and total quantity for each type of item, and output the price subtotal and total tax amount.

* Output Example:
  <br>*How many items will you buy? 3*
  <br>*Price of item 1: 25*
  <br>*Quantity of item 1: 2*
  <br>*Price of item 2: 10*
  <br>*Quantity of item 2: 1*
  <br>*Price of item 3: 4*
  <br>*Quantity of item 3: 1*

  <br>*Subtotal: $64.00*
  <br>*Tax: $4.48*
  <br>*Total: $68.48*

* Conditions
  * Write the input, calculation, and output sections separately in the program. After receiving all the input values, perform the calculation, generate the output string, and print the final result.
  * Be sure to convert the input value to numeric data before starting the calculation..
