## Currency Conversion

Write a program to convert the exchange rate.
Here we convert from euros to US dollars.
First, after inputting the amount of the euro, the user inputs the exchange rate of the euro.
It then outputs the US dollar value for the euro.

* Output Example:
  <br>*How many Euros are you exchanging? 81*
  <br>*What is the exchange rate? 137.51*
  <br>*81 Euros at an exchange rate of 137.51 is*
  <br>*111.39 dollars*


* Conditions
  * If there is a number after the decimal point based on the cent, raise it with respect to the cent.
  * Use only one output statement.
