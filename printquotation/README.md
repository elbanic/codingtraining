## PrintQuotation

Write a quotation and a program that takes the person who said it.

* Output Example:
	<br>*What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for*
	<br>*Who said it? Elbanic*
	<br>*Elbanic says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."*

* Conditions:
	* Use only one output statement to print the result. You must use the appropriate escape character to print the quotes
	* If your programming language supports string interpolation or string substitution, do not use these features and just use string concatenation.
