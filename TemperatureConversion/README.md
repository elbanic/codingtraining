## Temperature Conversion

Write a program that converts between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures.
The formula used here is as follows.

***C = (F-32)x5/9***

***F = (Cx9/5)+32***

* Output Example:
  <br>*Press C to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius and F to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.*
  <br>*Press Key (C or F): C*

  <br>*Please enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: 32*
  <br>*The temperature in Celsius is 0.*

* Conditions
  * C and F should be input regardless of case.
  * Do not use output strings repeatedly while minimizing the number of output statements.
