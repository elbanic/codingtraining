## Simple Interest Calculator

Write a program to calculate the simple interest.
Input a principal, and input an interest rate to percentage, and input a period to year, then output the principal+interest.
Here is the simple interest equation.

A = P(1+rt)

P : principal
r : an annual interest
t : period
A : the principal and interest

* Output Example:
  <br>*Enter the principal: 1500*
  <br>*Enter the rate of interest: 4.3*
  <br>*Enter the number of years: 4*
  <br>*After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will be worth $1758*

* Conditions
  * Annual rate should be calculated by dividing the input value by 100 after the input in percentage.
  * If there is a number after the decimal point based on cents, raise it with respect to cents.
