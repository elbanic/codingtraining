## Paint Calculator

Write a program to get the amount of paint needed to fill the ceiling.
Let's calculate the length and the width, assuming that 1 liter is filled with 9 square meters.
And let's express the amount of paint needed to paint the ceiling as an integer.
To solve this problem, you have to ceil.

* Output Example:
  <br>*What is the area of the ceil in meters? 10*

  <br>*You will need to purchase 2 liters of paint*
  <br>*to cover 10 square meters.*

* Conditions
  * Use constants to store conversion constants.
  * Must be rounded up to integer.
