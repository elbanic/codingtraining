## Retirement Calculator

Write a program that calculates the number of years left until retirement and the number of years that you retire.
The program will show the current age and age of retirement as shown in the following output example.

* Output Example:
  <br>What is your current age? 32
  <br>At what age would you like to retire? 80
  <br>You have 48 years left until you can retire.
  <br>It's 2017, so you can retire in 2065.

* Conditions:
  * Be sure to convert input values ​​to numbers before using them in math calculations.
  * Do not put this year directly into the program. Get the system date through the dash programming language
