## Mad Libs

When someone creates a story, he or she frees several places for the word, and then the other person fills the empty space and makes the whole story.

* Output Example:
	* Enter a noun: dog
	* Enter a verb: walk
    * Enter an adjective: blue
    * Enter an adverb: quickly
    * Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

* Conditions:
	* Use only one output statement.
	* If your programming language supports string interpolation or string substitution, do not use these features and just use string concatenation.
