## Mad Libs

When someone creates a story, he or she frees several places for the word, and then the other person fills the empty space and makes the whole story.

* Output Example:
  <br>*Enter a noun: dog*
  <br>*Enter a verb: walk*
  <br>*Enter an adjective: blue*
  <br>*Enter an adverb: quickly*
  <br>*Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!*

* Conditions:
  * Use only one output statement.
  * If your programming language supports string interpolation or string substitution, do not use these features and just use string concatenation.
