## Simple Math

After inputting two numbers, we show the result of arithmetic operation using two numbers as the following output example.

* Output Example:
  <br>What is the first number? 10
  <br>What is the second number? 5
  <br>10 + 5 = 15
  <br>10 - 5 = 5
  <br>10 * 5 = 50
  <br>10 / 5 = 2

* Conditions:
  * Get input as a string. The string value must be converted to a numeric value before performing arithmetic operations.
  * Ensure that both input and output values ​​are not affected by numeric conversions and other processes.
  * Use only one output statement to put the newline character at the proper position.
