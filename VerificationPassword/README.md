## Verification Password

Write a simple program that verifies user login credentials.
The program receives the user name and password, compares the password for the pre-stored user name,
and displays "Welcome!" If the password matches, otherwise "That password is incorrect."

* Output Example:
  <br>*What is the password: 12345*
  <br>*That password is incorrect*

  or

  <br>*What is the password: abc$123*
  <br>*Welcome!*

* Conditions
  * Use an if / else statement to solve this problem.
  * User names and passwords are case-sensitive.
